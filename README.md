# Vector Space 
A vector space, as its name indicates, is the space for vectors, which defines two operations, addition and multiplication by scalars, subject to 10 axioms below.

1. The sum of u and v, denoted by u+v, is in V

2. u+v=v+u

3. (u+v)+w=u+(v+w)

4. There is a zero vector 0 in V such that u+0=u

5. For each u in V, there is a vector −u in V such that u+(−u)=0

6. The scalar multiple of u by c, denoted by cu, is in V

7. c(u+v)=cu+cv

8. (c+d)u=cu+du

9. c(du)=(cd)u

10. 1u=u

Though 10 axioms seem quite apparent and superfluous, simply remember this: addition and multiplication are closed in vector space.


All axioms are self-explanatory without proof, we can visualize axiom 7 with a user-defined function.
